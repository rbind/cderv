This is my personal website to share some finding, tips, tricks and my
experience using R and its ecosystem.

## Why this blog ? 

I found about R a few years ago when I wanted to analyze data in another 
environment than Excel, the only tool my company provided as the time. Since 
then, I fell in love with the R language, and dive into its community. It is a 
passion to discover new packages and understand how they work but also how they 
are made, to see how the R ecosystem evolves over the year, to learn about
anything R related and especially to help people in the community.

Following my interest, I contribute now as often as I can to open source projects
on Github. I digitally but regularly interact with the community on twitter : R
community is really a part of the programming language for me. 

Finding a way to be active in the community and give back is not easy. You won't
find any package from me (yet), just some PR here and there, some issue posts and answers on
github or stackoverflow, and some tweets to help spread the R vibes.

Having discover about the amazing Blogdown package and Hugo, I decided to add another
way to be more active and give it a try with blog.

I will share here all sort of findings, thoughts, tips and tricks I found. There
is so many things already on the web that it is "_just another blog_" but I hope 
it could be useful to someone. It is certainly better to keep track about what I 
learn and experiment here in the open rather than in another place more private.
